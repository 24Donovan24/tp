* Gim is a **desktop app for managing gym exercises, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Gim builds on the commands of Vim so if you can type fast and are an avid Vim user, Gim can optimize your exercise routines to a much greater capacity than traditional GUI apps.
  Example usages:
  * as a tracking tool to keep track of completed exercises
  * as a reminder tool for future exercises
* It is named `Gim` as a name-play tribute to `Vim` and `Gym`.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Gim Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t15-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
