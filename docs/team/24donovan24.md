### Project: Gim

Gim is a **desktop app for managing gym exercises, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Gim allows you to keep track your exercises and Personal Records in an efficient way.

Example usages:
* as a tracking tool to keep track of completed exercises
* as a tracking tool to keep track of your personal records
* as a workout generator to generate exercises based on your personal records

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Sort command ([PR #100](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/100))
    * What it does: Allows users to sort any displayed list of exercises by date of completion.
    * Justification: This feature is essential as sorting the exercises by date of completion allows users to better track their workout progression.
    * Highlights:
        * A defensive copy of the default ordering of exercises based off entry date has to be maintained to allow users to toggle between a sorted ordering and the default ordering.
        * Utilise Open-Closed Principle to accommodate other sorting orders should sorting criteria change in future.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=24donovan24&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
